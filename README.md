🍽️ Recipe Finder in C++

Welcome to Recipe Finder, a C++ project where you can add, manage, search, and organize recipes using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This project is perfect for anyone looking to practice their DSA skills in a real-world context like recipe management.
✅ Add new recipes with ingredients and steps
✅ Search recipes by name or ingredient
✅ Delete or update existing recipes
✅ List all saved recipes
✅ Store and manage recipes using appropriate DSA (like Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables, etc.)


🧠 Data Structures Used
Linked List – To store a dynamic list of recipes
Hash Table / Map – For fast search by ingredients or recipe name
Trees (optional) – To organize recipes alphabetically or categorically
Vectors/Arrays – For basic storage and iteration

🚀 How to Run

    Clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-finder.git
    cd recipe-finder

    Compile the code
    g++ main.cpp recipe.cpp utils.cpp -o recipe_finder

    Run the executable
    ./recipe_finder

✍️ Example Usage

    Add Recipe
    Enter name: Chicken Biryani
    Enter ingredients: Chicken, Rice, Spices
    Enter steps: Marinate -> Cook -> Layer -> Steam
    Search Recipe by Ingredient
    Enter keyword: Chicken
    Results: Chicken Biryani, Chicken Soup
    Delete Recipe
    Enter name: Chicken Soup
    Deleted successfully!

🎯 Learning Objectives
Practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
Implement and apply core Data Structures
Understand how to build interactive command-line applications
Learn how to handle file I/O (optional feature)

💡 Future Improvements
Add file storage to save recipes between runs
GUI using Qt or C++/CLI
